# Devil
Real time logger for android<br>
Built up on Mqtt - primarily designed for low speed networks.


# Debug - Error - Verbose - Info - Logger<br>
Project that demonstrates Realtime logging in android application.These logs can be monitored in 
a partner app called DevilBoard. This can really be useful while submitting the application for 
tester/client. As we can see the logs in realtime, the communication gap between the tester and 
developer can be decreased exponentially, which will decrease the development time. 
Also if something goes wrong while the tester is testing we have all the logs we need to debug the 
situation and pinpoint the cause of issue then and there. We can u use the same logs to identify 
bottle necks in api server and solve them efficiently. 
A Custom interceptor specially designed to work with retrofit to give accurate timestamps of 
request and response. The complete Devil logger will intercept all the network call in the 
application with only 2 lines of code. 


# Pros<br>

Intercepts all api calls in android with 2 lines of code<br>
Rule based - Local logs + Remote logs - each can be disabled and enabled individually<br>
Can monitor realtime user - online user count / offline user count<br>
Can give more data on api bottle necks. <br>
Filtering out individual user logs in realtime<br>
Can be easily implemented for other platforms as well.<br>
